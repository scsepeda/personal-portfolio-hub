# personal-portfolio-hub
ğŸš€ Just launched my personal portfolio!

I built it using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, bundled with Vite for a fast development experience. The project is fullstack, deployed on Render, and includes a simple API alongside a responsive frontend showcasing my work, skills, and contact info.

Tech stack:

ğŸ”¹ React + TypeScript

ğŸ”¹ Express.js (Node.js)

ğŸ”¹ Vite + ESBuild

ğŸ”¹ Drizzle ORM

ğŸ”¹ Hosted on Render

Would love any feedback! ğŸ’¬
